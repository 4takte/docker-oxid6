## Quickstart

```bash
# clone repository:
git clone https://github.com/proudcommerce/docker-oxid6.git docker_oxid6
cd docker_oxid6
# create container
docker-compose build
# fire up container
docker-compose up
```
## Configuration

### Installation
- Creating oxid project takes rund about 5 minutes. ItÂ´s finished when `data/www/source/.htaccess` exists.
- Shop url: `http://localhost`
- Shop admin credentials: `admin / admin`

### Credentials
- You can change container credentials (domain, ports, database) in `.env` file.
- If you change domain/port, edit `container/apache_php7/files/config.inc.php`.
- If you change database credentials, edit `container/apache_php7/files/config.inc.php` and `container/apache_php7/entrypoint.d/030-demodata.sh`.

### OXID demo data
- Normally oxid demo data will be installed automatically.
- If you only need a clean project, without demo data, remove `container/apache_php7/entrypoint.d/030-demodata.sh` before building the container.
